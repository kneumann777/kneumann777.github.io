            <p>Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower is a mid-level boss in FromSoftware's 2015 classic, Bloodborne. She can be found in the Astral Clocktower. She is seen sitting on a richly decorated chair, with blood pooling from her neck and wrist onto the floor. She is seemingly dead, but upon inspecting her, Maria grabs the Hunter's hand, then rises from her chair to fight them. </p>
            
            <p>According to both her equipment and her weapon, Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower was a citizen of Cainhurst and is a distant relative to Queen Annalise. She was also one of the first hunters to join the nightly hunt. She studied under Gehrman, the First Hunter, whom Maria had admired, unknowing of his curious mania towards her. Despite being a citizen of Cainhurst, where they relished in extravagant uses of blood, she favored her Rakuyo, which instead required dexterity and skill rather to wield effectively.</p>
            
            <p>Lady Maria begins the battle using her Rakuyo and Evelyn. She can also transform her weapon for moveset changes and fluid combo weaving. When her health is at two thirds, she will back away quickly, then plunge her blades into her chest. Not only does this cause a large burst of damaging blood, but she also unlocks powerful new moves. Using her own blood, Maria enhances both the katana and dagger halves of her Rakuyo, as the blood seems to have solidified on the blade. This will not only increase her damage, but also her attack range.</p>
