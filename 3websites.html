    <h1>One Bad Webite and Two Good Websites</h1>

    <h2>Bad Website: <a href="https://twitter.com/home?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a></h2>

    <p>
        The first place to start with Twitter is the branding. Is it Twitter, as Googling it suggests? Or is it X, as the logo suggests? As we all know, Elon Musk has made the decision to rebrand Twitter into X, without actually following through on the rebranding. What's left is a weird mishmash of old Twitter and new X, blending black and blue. It's disjointed. The url is still Twitter, but the logo is different.
        Navigating Twitter is still relatively easy. Except now the For You page is bogged down with posts from random accounts, often pushing harmful narratives. The Following page is often missing posts from accounts one is actually following, leaving one left with no other choice but to navigate to those specific accounts and scroll through their post history, which is not what Twitter was designed to do.

        Looking at the code gives me anxiety. It seems like the majority of the code is a css sheet. Also, even in the code there's branding issues, such as the top of the code using X, and then a few lines later using Twitter. I also noticed that the title on the tab of the source code uses the old Twitter logo, while the Home tab uses the new X logo. Also, there is almost no indenting for the majority of the code. Considering the fact that a substantial amount of employees left within the first month of Elon Musk owning Twitter, it's not surprise that the site now reads like a project that's only a quarter finished. When you are a big brand, keeping your branding consistent is extremely important. And rebranding usually involves a completed aspect, including name changes and stylizing. The fact that none of these things has been done is what makes Twitter (or X) the worst website for me.

    <h2>Good Website: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a></h2>
    <p>
        YouTube gets a spot on the good website's list because of how easy it is to use. Everything i set out intuitively, most importantly with the search bar front and center. The left side bar contains everything else you could possibly need if you don't want to type out your search. The home page contains a mix of videos from your subscribed channels, recommended videos based on what you've watched before, as well as a couple wild card recommendations YouTube is banking on you liking. The branding is clean and consistent, the site is mostly done in white with a little red and black sprinkled in. The black and white switch in dark mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        The text formatting is pleasing to the eye and easy to look at. Each video thumbnail has rounded corners, which also makes the site look more refined. They also include a Featured bar which has art and a link to videos that fit into the theme, which changes. The code isn't really formatted, and is in one huge block. There's also a substantial amount of it, though most of it seems to be related to the function of the site, which may explain why it's not overly stylized. It's also worth mentioning that given the amount of information that YouTube contains, and is still gathering daily, it works extremely well for what it is.

    <h2>Good Website: <a href="https://www.airforce.com/" target="_blank">Air Force</a></h2>
    <p>
        The first thing you're greeted with arriving at the Air Force website is the Air Force logo and a banner with a video autoplaying of a variety of Air Force positions. Just beneath it, there's an option to click to find the path for you, which, when clicked, promptly scrolls you to the different options for joining the Air Force, each with it's own learn more link. The Air Force website gets a spot on the list because its ease of use and consistent branding throughout. The colors are navy and white with beige accents. The search bar is at the top, but it's also easy to find most information just by scrolling through the home page. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the coolest things about the Air Force website is the base locator. Clicking on the widget takes you to another page, where you can either use the search box to find a base, or just browse the bases. Should you choose to browse, this option takes you to a map with base locations - again stylizing it so it fits into the overall theme of the site. 
        The code is easy to look at and easy to understand. Everything has been organized well (although the css file looks like it could use some oganization). Everything looks clean and modern. Of course, given the fact that the Air Force is known to be the "technology" branch of the military, I would expect nothing less than excellence out of their website.
