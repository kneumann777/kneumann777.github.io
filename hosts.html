        <h1>Web Host Assignment</h1>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a></h2>
        
        <p>HostGator starts at $3.75 per month for the basic package. They have free site transfers, so if you already have a website it's easy to transfer it directly to HostGator. HostGator also has unlimited bandwidth, so sites will stay up consistently and run smoothly. They're also known for their customer support, and will walk you through the entire process and troubleshoot if something goes wrong. They offer the first year of domain registration for free. They also provide advertising credit and a free email. They have a basic shared space option, a WordPress option that allows for more customization, a VPS option, as well as a dedicated option, so you can have your own slice of the web completely to yourself.</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a></h2>
        
        <p>GoDaddy starts at $9.99 per month for the basic package, but includes free trials and start-up deals. They emphasize helping small businesses, and have tools that can be used such as setting up a shop and accepting payments. They have unlimited bandwidth, domain transfers, as well as tools such as Website Building and Logo Builder. Domains are only $0.01 for the first year. GoDaddy has a basic package, a premium package, and two shop packages called Commerce and Commerce Plus, both with tools that can assist in business.</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.ionos.com/">ionos or 1and1</a></h2>
        <p>ionos starts at $1 per month for the basic package. They offer cloud computing and cloud backups, free domains, email addresses, and malware scanning. They include automatic updates and have thorough customer support. ionos has a basic package, a Grow package, and a Boost package. The only major difference between the three packages is the site space and site loading speeds.</p>
        
        <h3>My Opinion</h3>
        <p>I would probably go with HostGator because it's cheap from the beginning, but also provides more expansive packages if you decide you want to build your brand more in the future.</p>
