            <p>Summer is the best time to visit Alaska. Not only is the weather as warm as it's going to get (between 60 and 80 degrees), the sun is also out for over 15 hours, up to 22 in Fairbanks. There's also a plethora of outdoor activities to choose from, including kayaking, hiking, and camping. This is also the best time to view wildlife, as they are most active. And summer is peak cruise season in Alaska, meaning if you want to see Alaska by boat, summer is the best time to visit. All of the seasonal shops are open as well. </p>
